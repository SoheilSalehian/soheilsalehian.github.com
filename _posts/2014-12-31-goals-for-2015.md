title: "My personal goals for 2015"
---

Well, this year is now almost over, and I didn't accomplish most of thing I
planned to do. I see now that I set goals almost impossible to accomplish in
that amount of time.

Well, I do read one book per month, for example (well, actually, I read 1,5
books per month). I do keep doing exercises. I do changed jobs. I learned a
lot of stuff. But, I didn't bought a car (yet I'm paying it). I didn't keep
studying music. I didn't learn and profit in 2 more languages. That's quite a
shame.

So, for this new year, I will aim to things a little easier to accomplish,
following something I read in "The Passionate Programmer".

So, those are my goals for 2015:

- Read 2 books per month (it was quite easy to do 1,5);
- Keep practicing my English;
- Do at least one post every two weeks here;
- Master one new programming language;
- Continue to do exercises;
- Stop paying rent and buy an apartment or something.

Except the last item, all of those are things that I want to actually keep
doing the whole year. The last item, though, is the more challenging, because
it involves money, and the current Brazilian economy may not let me do
anything, nut I will try anyway.

Those are my goals, what about yours?
