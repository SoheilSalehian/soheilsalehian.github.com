title: "Rigid processes might not be the right answer"
---

I have worked in very small companies, big companies and small companies
in growth process.

One thing that always sounds legit to me: more people, more processes.

Don't get me wrong. I do believe that some kind of processes must exist.
What I don't believe is that they should exist in a large amount. I recently
found a quote about politics that I think applies perfectly in this
scenario:

![The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws. - Tacitus](/public/images/the more corrupt the state the more numerous the laws.jpg)

I think we can translate this to something like that:

> Laws are only needed when values are not present.

A little harsh, huh? Let's explore the subject.

A well known example of absence of values is the Brazilian "culture".
Here, we have a law for almost all stupid corner cases of almost all
stupid stuff a stupid human being might want do. The result is a
book of laws that no one really knows, full
of design flaws explored to set criminals free.
tl;dr: that shitty book just won't really work - ever.


To take responsibility for your own mistakes, to want someone to
review your code because you know you are not perfect and might as well
commit mistakes like anyone else, to know that, like a musician, you are
not paid to practice, to always want to improve as a human being and as a
professional, for me, seems like nice values to have.

I know, that's a little harsh. But, think about it: why do your team have
_that_ rule/formal process? Because one day someone screw that up, am I right?

It seems to me that most rules are created to reduce the chances of a human
error, like, forgot to something while updating a server, for example. Other
examples usually are related to the coding process by itself.



In such
cases I believe that the thought is right, but the method is wrong. Most of
