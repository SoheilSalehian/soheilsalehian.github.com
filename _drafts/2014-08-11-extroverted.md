title: "Living in an extroverted world"
---

In the last Joinville Software Craftsmanship Meetup, after a lot of talk about
software, we somehow entered in the "people" subject.

One of the group said that he taught that I was extroverted, until he saw me
giving a talk in the last Joinville Software Meetup. Then I confirmed that I'm
an introverted and forget about this subject. I also said that I was "worse"
sometime ago and that I'm trying to improve. We discussed a little more about
this subject and eventually we were talking about other things.

But, for some random reason, today, while I was observing some people behavior
and rethinking mine, this subject came again in my mind.

Been an introvert those days is really hard. The society wants us to be
extroverts and to interact with others. The society somehow make people think
that being an introvert is a bad thing.

It's not bad. It's just different.

There is this really awesome talk by Susan Cain, called "The Power of
Introverts". I strongly recomend you to watch this, wether you are a introvert
or not:
