title: "161 days of contributions"
---

Last months, I was in a personal and lonely crusade. I decided to try to do at
least one commit per day.

161 days of commits latter, here I am to describe what I learned.

## 1. It's easier than you think

It seems hard when you first think of it, but, after a couple of days, it
becomes a natural thing to do. You will feel the need to work on something
every day.


## It's good for you as a professional

1. You will learn things;
1. You will know more people;
1. You can work with something different from what you do in work.

For me, these 3 point were enough reason. I like learn things. It useful to
know more people (contacts). It's nice to work in different things - it helps
me see stuff from another point of view.

## It's hard to stop

Some days ago, I said that after 160 days of contributions, I'll be on
vacations. Truth is, every single time I got my laptop on my lap, I checked
Github. Including the first day, when I actually did some contributions.

Now I'm 3 days without contributions. Feels good, also. :beer:
