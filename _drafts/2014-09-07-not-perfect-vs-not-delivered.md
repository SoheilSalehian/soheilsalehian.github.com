title: "Not Perfect vs Not Delivered"

When I was young and even more stupid then I am now, I believed that I could,
one day, write a perfect software - both in code design and UI/UX. No, really,
how hard can it be? Just write it down the right way and profit. Easy as pie.

Well, I never was so wrong.
